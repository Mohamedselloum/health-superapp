# Health SuperApp - Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Health SuperApp, covering various testing types to ensure the application's quality, reliability, performance, and security.

## 1. Unit Testing

**Purpose:** To verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.

**Scope:**
- Backend (NestJS): Services, controllers, modules, utility functions.
- Admin Web (Next.js): React components, utility functions, API client logic.
- Mobile App (React Native): React Native components, utility functions, API client logic.

**Tools:**
- Jest (for JavaScript/TypeScript projects)
- React Testing Library (for React/React Native components)

**Process:**
- Write unit tests for all critical business logic and components.
- Ensure high code coverage (aim for >80%).
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI pipeline.

## 2. Integration Testing

**Purpose:** To verify that different modules or services within the application interact correctly.

**Scope:**
- Backend: API endpoint interactions with services, database, and external APIs (Supabase, OpenAI, Stripe).
- Admin Web/Mobile App: Frontend components interacting with the backend API.

**Tools:**
- Jest (for backend service integration)
- Supertest (for testing HTTP endpoints in NestJS)
- Mocking libraries (e.g., `jest-mock-extended`)

**Process:**
- Test the flow of data between integrated components.
- Use mock services for external dependencies to isolate integration points.
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI pipeline.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and verify the entire application flow from start to finish.

**Scope:**
- User registration and login.
- Health guide browsing and interaction.
- Product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.
- AI chat interactions.
- Admin panel operations (creating/editing content, managing users).

**Tools:**
- Playwright (for web-based E2E testing of Admin Web)
- Detox (for React Native mobile app E2E testing)

**Process:**
- Define critical user journeys and create test scripts.
- Run tests against a deployed development or staging environment.
- Integrate E2E tests into the CD pipeline for automated regression testing.

## 4. Performance Testing

**Purpose:** To assess the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.

**Scope:**
- API response times under concurrent user load.
- Database query performance.
- Frontend rendering performance.
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory) of backend services.

**Tools:**
- k6 (for API load testing)
- JMeter (for more complex load scenarios)
- Lighthouse (for web performance audits)

**Process:**
- Define performance benchmarks and thresholds.
- Simulate different user loads (e.g., normal, peak, stress).
- Identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

## 5. Security Testing

**Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security posture.

**Scope:**
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Input validation and sanitization.
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest).
- API security (OWASP Top 10).
- Dependency vulnerabilities.

**Tools:**
- OWASP ZAP (Dynamic Application Security Testing - DAST)
- Trivy (Container image vulnerability scanning - already in CI)
- Snyk (Dependency vulnerability scanning - already in CI)
- Manual penetration testing

**Process:**
- Conduct regular security scans and audits.
- Implement secure coding practices.
- Address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

## 6. Debugging and Monitoring

**Purpose:** To identify, analyze, and resolve issues during development and in production.

**Tools:**
- Debuggers (VS Code debugger, Node.js inspector)
- Logging (Winston, Pino for NestJS; console for frontend)
- CloudWatch Logs (for centralized logging in AWS)
- CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms (for infrastructure and application monitoring)
- Sentry/Datadog (for error tracking and performance monitoring)

**Process:**
- Implement robust logging across all application layers.
- Set up real-time monitoring and alerting for critical metrics.
- Use debugging tools to step through code and diagnose issues.
- Establish a clear incident response process.

## Testing Environments

- **Development Environment**: Local machines for unit and integration testing.
- **Staging Environment**: A replica of the production environment for E2E, performance, and security testing.
- **Production Environment**: Continuous monitoring and incident response.
