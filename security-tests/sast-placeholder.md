# Health SuperApp - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) results and configurations.

## SAST Tools Integration:

- **ESLint**: Already integrated into the CI pipeline for JavaScript/TypeScript code quality and basic security checks.
- **Trivy**: Already integrated into the CI pipeline for Docker image vulnerability scanning.
- **CodeQL**: Already integrated into the CI pipeline for advanced static analysis of JavaScript/TypeScript code.

## Future SAST Enhancements:

- **Dedicated SAST Tool**: Integrate a more comprehensive SAST tool like SonarQube, Snyk Code, or Checkmarx for deeper code analysis.
- **Custom Rules**: Develop custom SAST rules to enforce specific security policies relevant to the Health SuperApp.
- **Automated Remediation**: Explore automated code remediation suggestions based on SAST findings.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed SAST reports for compliance and auditing purposes.

## Manual Code Review:

In addition to automated SAST, regular manual code reviews should be conducted to identify complex security vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

## Best Practices for Secure Coding:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command Injection).
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all output to prevent XSS.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Session Management**: Securely manage user sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling to avoid information leakage.
- **Logging**: Log security-relevant events for auditing and incident response.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update and audit third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive information securely using AWS Secrets Manager (already implemented in Terraform).
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Secure Configuration**: Configure all components (servers, databases, applications) securely.

This placeholder will be replaced with actual SAST configuration and results once a dedicated SAST tool is integrated and executed.
